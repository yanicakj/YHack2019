@JetBlue @JetBlue If safety is your biggest concern, why load hundreds of people on a plane that had to be towed from the runway back to the gate?  #JetBlue #Delay #Unreliable #ihavetogettowork@JetBlue Safety is and should absolutely be your priority..   Having a safe plane READY for the hundreds of people you boarded onto that plane!  Why wait until we are all boarded and on the plane to make sure it’s safe if it’s your priority?  My inner Karen is coming out.  #Karen #JetBlue@JetBlue 2.5 hour delay because no other plane.  No guarantee of getting out of here today.  WTF.  Not even enough seats in terminal for our entire flight either.  #Nightmare #JetBlue@JetBlue missing my meeting in Las Vegas because of a plane that was deemed unsafe.  Always fun boarding a plane, sitting for 90 minutes then being delayed hours.  #JetBlue #JetBlueFlashFares #unreliableWhy #LaRomanaAirport?

Meanwhile a 6 hour flight to Long Beach and there’s no midflight water service and a rushed 2nd beverage service. 🤷🏻‍♀️ #JetBlueTSA enjoyed my sense of humor again! 

TSA: “Unless your board passing was stamped.”

ME: “No, but I’m glad they didn’t stamp my phone.

#aviation #travel #tourism #JetBlue @JetBlue @Fly_Norwegian #vacation #holiday  https://t.co/lq5YxlKMsj via @UK_AviationNewsThis is all wrong. I shouldn't be stuck in an airport for 40+ hours. I should be on vacation in a beach resort. Yet you come to me for $600 flight costs and baggage fees! How dare you.

#Jetblue has stolen my vacation and my fun with its mechanical issues.

Flight 516. Jet blue is saying it is due to weather and JFK runaway construction. However, other airlines (Delta, Alaska, American) departed SFO on time. So does the weather only affect jet blue?

They don’t get the Yankee game here  #ugh #wind #JetBlue #nola #JFKHello @JetBlue. My reservation tonight is to JFK and the system and the representative is telling me that there is a change fee with cancelling however due to the Northeast Inclement Weather of today I should have the fee waived.
